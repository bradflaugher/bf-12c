# bf-12c

A hyper-modern Android calculator and homage to the HP-12C. Real RPN, the
real 12c keyboard, 34 significant digits, and an 80s green-screen display.

## What it is

- **The 12c keyboard, key for key.** Landscape is the classic 4×10 layout:
  gold `f` legends above, blue `g` legends below, the tall ENTER, and the
  BOND / DEPRECIATION / CLEAR brackets. Portrait folds it in half, financial
  keys on top and the number pad at the bottom where your thumbs are.
- **RPN with a 4-level stack** (X Y Z T), LSTx, stack lift that behaves like
  the real thing, and continuous memory: everything survives restarts.
- **34 significant digits** in every register (BigDecimal, not doubles).
  `f EEX` shows ALL digits, `f 0`–`9` sets FIX, `f .` sets SCI. When the
  display is rounded, the full-precision value is shown beneath it.
- **The 12c function set:** TVM (n, i, PV, PMT, FV, BEGIN/END, 12×, 12÷),
  NPV / IRR with CF₀ / CFⱼ / Nⱼ, AMORT, simple interest, SL / SOYD / DB
  depreciation, bond PRICE / YTM, DATE / ΔDYS (D.MY and M.DY), statistics
  (Σ+, Σ−, x̄, s, x̄w, x̂,r, ŷ,r), %, Δ%, %T, yˣ, √x, eˣ, LN, n!, FRAC, INTG,
  RND, 20 storage registers with STO arithmetic.
- **Keystroke programming:** `f P/R`, 99 merged-keycode lines, `GTO`,
  `x≤y`, `x=0`, `R/S`, `PSE`, `SST` / `BST`. The listing shows the 12c
  keycodes *and* a readable mnemonic.
- **Modern touches:** swipe the display left to backspace (or `g −`),
  long-press to copy X, double-tap to paste. The `ON` key opens a system
  menu with four phosphors: P1 green, P3 amber, ice, and a classic 12c LCD.
- **No permissions at all.** No network, no backups, no analytics.

## Install

Grab `bf-12c.apk` from the [latest release](../../releases/latest) and
sideload it. Every push to `main` publishes a single date-labeled release
(`vYYYY.MM.DD.N`) and deletes the previous one. Verify with the attached
`bf-12c.apk.sha256`.

Android 17 (API 37) or newer only — see `AGENTS.md` for the latest-only policy.

## Build

```sh
./gradlew lint test assembleDebug     # what CI runs (plus assembleRelease)
```

Signed release builds need all four of `BF12C_KEYSTORE_PATH`,
`BF12C_STORE_PASSWORD`, `BF12C_KEY_ALIAS`, `BF12C_KEY_PASSWORD` (or none, for
an unsigned build). CI restores the keystore from the
`BF12C_KEYSTORE_BASE64` secret.
